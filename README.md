# Bulls & Cows 
### A SailsJS adventure
Welcome to the the page of my humble effort to make a Bulls & Cows game :)

### Installation
Node & NPM are a clear requirements for this one, but you'll also need Bower for the front-end stuff. To install bower run:

```
npm install -g bower
```

To install the game requirements, run from the project folder:

```
npm install
bower install
```

### Launching the game
Start the app using `./launch.sh` and then access it at `http://localhost:1337/`
